## SpatialClustering

There are a total of 13 spatial clustering methods in our study, each with its unique approach to spatial analysis. The methods included are Louvain, Leiden, SpaGCN (with and without histological image, denoted as SpaGCN(HE) and SpaGCN respectively), BayesSpace, StLearn, SEDR, CCST, SCAN-IT, STAGATE, SpaceFlow, conST, BASS, and DeepST.

 we performed spatial clustering analysis on two datasets as representative examples: Data 9, which is based on sequencing using the 10x Visium technology, specifically the DLPFC dataset of sample 151673, and Data 21, which is based on imaging using the osmFISH technology.
