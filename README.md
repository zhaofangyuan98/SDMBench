# SDMBench
we presented a benchmark study of 14 computational methods on 30 real and 20 simulated SRT datasets. The performance was evaluated based on accuracy, spatial continuity, marker genes detection, scalability, and robustness.We found that the existing methods were complementary in terms of their performance and functionality, and provided guidance for selecting the most appropriate method for a given scenario. We identified the major limitations of existing methods and demonstrated their inadequacies using a recent large-scale task.
